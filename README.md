# Padoq - Technical Test

Thank you for agreeing to undertake a short technical test for Padoq.  We would like you to look at the code here and do as many of the following things you can in 2 hours maximum.  this isn't about "achieving the result in two hours" but about simply putting a reasonable time limit to ensure that we don't ask for too much of your time to assess this task.

* Write a small EXPLAIN.md file that explains what is happening here
* Modify the code so that the components are in separate files
* Modify the components so that they are function based components
* Write tests for the new setup

We aren't looking for perfection - the main aim is that we get to understand how you handle code understanding, code refactoring, and testing.

The most important part of this for us would be that you are able to understand code, refactor it and write function based components for react that are testable.

once you have completed as much of this as possible in two hours, we would really value a file called NEXTSTEPS.md that explains

* How you approached the test
* What you would do differently if you took the test again
* Improvements to the application you can suggest that could be implemented, and an estimation of how much time they would take.

Again we're not looking for perfection in this, it's to assist in capturing your thought process.

# IMPORTANT NOTES

Please create your own repository from this one, and push all changes to that repository.  When you have completed this test, let the person who sent you this test know and let them have the Repository link.

We would be looking for these to be back to us by the end of the day 31/01/2022.  We will give feedback to all applicants on this tech test, and where relevant give you details of proceeding to the final interview.
